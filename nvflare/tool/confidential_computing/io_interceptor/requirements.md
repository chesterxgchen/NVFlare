# IO Interceptor Requirements

## 1. Core Requirements

### Access Control
- Whitelist-based path access control
- System path read-only protection
- Temporary filesystem read-write access
- Path pattern matching support

### Encryption
- Pattern-based encryption policies
- Two encryption modes:
  - Read-Write (RW): Full encryption for both reads and writes
  - Write-Only (WO): Encrypt only write operations
- Support for file patterns (e.g., *.pt, *.ckpt)
- Transparent encryption/decryption

### Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Operation auditing
- Path sanitization for logs
- Monitoring metrics

## 2. Encryption Requirements

### Pattern-Based Encryption
- Support glob patterns for file matching
- Configure encryption policies per pattern
- Maximum 128 encryption patterns
- Default to no encryption if no pattern matches

### Encryption Policies
```
Read-Write Patterns:
- Model files: /workspace/models/*.pt
- Checkpoints: /workspace/checkpoints/*.ckpt
- State files: /workspace/state/*.state

Write-Only Patterns:
- Log files: /var/log/nvflare/*.log
- Metrics: /workspace/metrics/*.json
```

### Encryption Operations
- Transparent to applications
- Automatic key management
- IV generation per file
- Secure key cleanup

## 3. Security Requirements

### Path Security
- No path traversal
- No symlink attacks
- Pattern validation
- Safe pattern matching

### Memory Security
- Secure key handling
- Memory wiping
- Buffer overflow protection
- Safe memory allocation

### Operation Security
- Operation validation
- Safe file descriptor tracking
- Error handling
- Resource cleanup

## 4. Performance Requirements

### Overhead
- Minimal encryption overhead
- Efficient pattern matching
- Optimized file operations
- Resource-efficient tracking

### Scalability
- Handle multiple patterns
- Support concurrent operations
- Manage multiple file descriptors
- Scale with file size

- Network lockdown
- Traffic control
- Network isolation

## Notes

1. **Implementation Verification**
   - All implemented features have unit tests
   - Integration tests cover key workflows
   - Security testing performed

2. **Performance Impact**

3. **Security Boundaries**
   - Focuses on I/O and memory protection
   - Complements TEE memory encryption
   - Does not protect against all side-channels
